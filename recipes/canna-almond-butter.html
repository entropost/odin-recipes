    <p>Feel free to swap out the pound of almonds in this recipe for just about any other nut. This recipe is also easily halved if you feel like 2 cups is too much for you. You can always make 2 8-ounce jars and give one away. The amount of canna-oil/canna-coco oil you use is up to you, and the strength of your oil should be taken in to account. If you know that half a teaspoon is a good dose with your oil, use 8 teaspoons, or 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons, for this recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound/16 ounces of almonds, toasted if desired</li>
        <li>2-4 tablespoons of canna-coco oil, or other infused oil (nut oils are great, if available)</li>
        <li>Sea salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If you’d like to toast the nuts before blending, which yields a really nice flavor and makes it a bit easier to blend, do so shortly before you are ready to make the nut butter. You can also buy roasted nuts from the store. If you prefer to leave them raw, skip this step!</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350° F and put the nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the hot oven for 8-10 minutes, checking them often and stirring if they are toasting unevenly. By the time you can smell them, they are done! Take them out of the oven and let cool slightly. If you think they are in danger of being over-toasted, immediately transfer them to a cool plate or pan to stop the cooking faster.</li>
        <li>Transfer the still-warm nuts to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the S-blade, or the pitcher of a high-powered blender. Pulse the nuts in the processor or blender and scrape down the sides. Continue to blend in this way until a paste begins to form. It may seem dry, but the oils of the nuts will release as they are blended. You can also now add your canna-oil, which will help with the blending. If you do not want to get dosed while cooking, taste the mixture before you add the oil and adjust the salt level, adding other spices or flavorings if you’d like. After all ingredients are added, continue blending to the consistency you prefer. Do not add water or any other liquid, rather add a little unmedicated oil if you feel your nut butter is too dry.</li>
        <li>Transfer the nut butter from the processor or blender to a clean 16-ounce jar, or 2 8-ounce jars. Store in the refrigerator for the longest shelf life, but still try to eat it within 2-3 weeks.</li>
